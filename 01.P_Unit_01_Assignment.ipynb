    "\n",
    "### 1. Problem Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "As a new graduate student, your research is examining the performance of 5-day precipitation forecasts at a number of Snotel sites in the Upper Boise River Basin. The forecasts are generated by a research center at a university in the western United States using the [Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/) model. They run a 360 hr (i.e., 15 day) forecast using WRF every day at the top of every hour for the entire western United States, and puts the output you need on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket that is freely available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "File pattern:\n",
    "WRF_fcst_YYYYMMDD_HHz_VVV.nc\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- YYYY is the year of the forecast date\n",
    "- MM is the month of the forecast date\n",
    "- DD is the day of the forecast\n",
    "- HH is the hour the forecast was initiated (0-23)\n",
    "- VVV is the valid hour of the forecast from the time of initiation in hours (0-360 hr in 3 hr increments). So 000 is the initial hour of the forecast, 003 would be the 3rd hour, 006 the 6th, and so forth.\n",
    "- 'WRF_fcst_' is the prefix of the file name\n",
    "- '.nc' is the file extension (this stands for NetCDF file - a real file format)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes as input the forecast year, month, day, and hour, as well as a maximum valid hour and returns a list of file names that contain the forecast data\n",
    "2. Test your code for three days (2025-03-01, 2025-04-01, and 2025-05-01), for forecast hour 6, and a maximum valid hour of 120 hours. Print the results of the returned list to the screen and verify manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Concepts Assessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- String handling\n",
    "- For loops\n",
    "- Basic functions"

    "## Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Problem Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You just started grad school and inhereted some code from the final chapter of a previous student's thesis. That last chapter was completed in about 1 month and your advisor has said they want you to follow up on the precipitation analysis the student has done with a new version of the precipitation dataset that was just released. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you dig through their code to make it work, you realize it's not commented well at all. Additionally, the student is now working Goldman Sachs working on CliFi (climate finance) problems and, well, you can't afford their hourly rate to get some help! In order to get the data, you would need to modify the name of the files, because the revised dataset uses a different naming convention. The previous student's code to create a list of the names of files to download and analyze is below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your own words, what does the code do? Is it correct? \n",
    "2. Go through the old student's code and add comments describing what the code is doing. Comments should be thorough enough that they're helpful for you, but also the student that comes after you. \n",

    "2.1.1 IsLeapYear takes one argument called year and returns a boolean. The function body contains nested if statements that controls code execution based on the result of modulo expressions. If the year argument is divisible by 4 AND 500 with remainder 0 the function returns True. If the number is divisible by 4 AND 100 with remainder 0 the function returns False. If the function is divisible only by 4 with remainder 0 the function returns True. If the function is not evenly divisble by 4 the function returns False.\n",
    "2.1.2 ReturnFileList takes two string and two number arguments and returns a list of strings. The body of the function starts with a list of int assigned to variable DiM (a very opaque name) which represents the number of days in each month of a non-leap year. There are a couple of inialization variables for year and the empty file name list. Then theres a series of nested loops with logic to construct the file name string. The outer most loop iterates over the number of years between the startYear and endYear arguments, adding an additional value at the end because the range function is not inclusive. The second loop inwards iterates over a range of 12. Inside this for loop is an if statement that returns True if the index value j is exactly equal to 2 AND the IsLeapYear function returns True for the local year variable then a new variable days_in_month variable is initialized and assigned a value of 29. When the if statement returns False the days_in_month variable is assigned the value of the locally defined DiM at index j. The third loop iterates over the index range in whatever day_in_month value is assigned above. This loop complies the file name f-string with formatting and append the f-string to the files list. The now non-empty files list is returned.\n",

    "These function seem to produce the correct outputs for the years given since the number of files in the list is 1096 and one of the years is a leap year 365 + 366 + 365 = 1096 BUT this function will give correct output for all years. The correct logic for the second if statement must be `if (year % 400 == 0):`. This sent me down a rabbit hole learning new things about leap years.\n",
